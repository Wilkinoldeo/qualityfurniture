For smaller rooms, round or square tables work best, while larger spaces can accommodate rectangular tables that offer more seating.</p></li><li><p><strong>Material and Finish</strong>:<br>Acme Furniture dining sets come in various materials, including solid wood, engineered wood, and metal. Consider the style of your home and the level of maintenance you're comfortable with. Wood is durable and timeless but may require more care, while metal and glass designs often have a sleek, modern appeal and are easier to maintain.</p></li><li><p><strong>Seating Capacity</strong>:If you frequently host guests or have a large family, you'll need a larger table with more seating.

To protect your dining set, place it in areas with indirect sunlight or use curtains to block out harsh rays.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use Protectors</strong>:<br>Always use coasters, placemats, or tablecloths to protect your table from spills, heat, and scratches. This will help maintain the quality of the surface.</p></li><li><p><strong>Regular Cleaning</strong>:<br>Dust your dining set regularly with a soft cloth to remove dirt and prevent buildup. For deeper cleaning, use a damp cloth with a mild soap solution. Avoid harsh chemicals that could damage the finish.</p></li></ul><h2>Why Choose Acme Furniture Dining Room Sets?</h2><p>Acme Furniture dining room sets stand out for their <strong>quality craftsmanship</strong>, <strong>affordable luxury</strong>, and <strong>wide selection</strong> of styles.
